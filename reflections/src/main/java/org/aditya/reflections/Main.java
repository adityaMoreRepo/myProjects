        //This is great! and kind of gives a birds eye view about our program and classes and objects.
        //But, it kind of leaves a question Why would you use this?
        //Reflections give meta level abilities :). It sort of changes classes at the runtime.
        //It is heavily used in frameworks like spring.
        //It has to be compatible with the code that hasn't been created yet.
        //A basic use case would be : Let's say we have a private method that tinkers around the
        //others methods and fields in the class. If we want to test this method then we can make use of reflections. ðŸ˜Š


        //Downside of the Reflections:
        //It can easily break the code.
        //Can cause lots of bugs
        //Because it uses runtime it causes sluggishness in the code.
